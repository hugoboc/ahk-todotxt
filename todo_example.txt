+HD_modification_info @Trimmer: 20.07.18 13:50:06 email sent to Hanna from belvac asking for documentation about the EMC cartridges.

Waiting for reply. - 24.07.18 Olga answered, sent some flyers, but no price. Waiting for price - 24.07.18 Olga replied. EMC is cheaper, circa 4000USD. Is it really worth to convert the HD cartridge? It a 10 year old solution, and EMC came out around 15 years ago, so maybe it´s not worth to convert HD cartridges (and they are becoming obsolete in the near future, acording do Belvac) and Belvac also has a replacement program for the EMC cartridge
